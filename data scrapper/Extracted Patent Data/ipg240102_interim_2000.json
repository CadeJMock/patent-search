    "description": "The present invention applies to vape type devices also known as e-cigarettes and e-cigars. To expand the capabilities of Vape type devices, added here is programmable multi mixable flavors and wide temperature controls per flavor, programmable flavor sequencing as well as a self-cleaning capability. A “green” feature includes vaping by way of non combustion techniques. “Green” in context means non carcinogenic. The continued expansion of settings where it will be acceptable to allow the use of Vape type devices is represented by the exhalation filtration feature, which is offered with a wider bore than the intake bore to permit a more comfortable exhalation. The novelties of more than one flavor and temperature controls are included in this invention. In order to avoid having to carry two devices, a Vape device and a filtration type device, the two are merged into one convenient device for portability, the larger exterior bore device to further act as a stand reducing table top foot print use and provision of the addition of some electronic features included for locating the device, theft avoidance and to electronically certify the user has diligently utilized the filter in public or regulated spaces. The added novelties increase the versatility of the device and satisfaction of the user, providing more than one flavor in a single draw and the opportunity to deliver a “cool vape” experience. With these increased functions, the use of the device for medicinal purposes and homeopathic purposes increases in potential. With the advent of mixing flavors and use for drug delivery or homeopathic product delivery, the output filter is important in order to allow one to use the device as a personal comfort, while not detracting from anyone else, even in extreme close proximity."

A three-dimensional computer model of the patient's heart produced from imaging data is used to fabricate a personalized or patient-specific customized ablation catheter. The personalized ablation catheter is shaped to fit the unique anatomy of the patient's left atrium and has ablation elements that correspond with each of the patient's pulmonary vein ostia. Ostial fitment elements engage the ostia to align the ablation elements and a base ring attached by spring members urges the ablation elements into apposition with the inner wall of the left atrium. A neuroprotective mesh is attached across the ring to capture and remove potential emboli. Ablation energy, such as radiofrequency energy, is applied through the ablation elements. Electrodes located on the personalized ablation catheter are used to verify electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins at the completion of the procedure."

In an embodiment, the instrument architecture includes US and TA analog components, including a transducer, TA preamplifier, pulser, switches, and AFE (or ADC with programmable amplifier) arranged in a way which allows efficient usage of the same transducer elements, electronic components, wiring, and AFE channels in both US and TA modalities. The operation with fast power control over the TA preamplifier is described, which allows turning off the TA preamplifier power between TA measurements cycles with or without US measurement between TA measurements. TA preamplifier energy saving allows such designs to reduce TA preamplifier power consumption many times, which enables TA preamplifier integration inside transducer housing or probe housing, and/or the use of the TA preamplifier in portable battery-operated or hand-held devices."

These signals generated at very low power levels are emitted and acquired using an antenna mounted to a wearable device. Information about changes to the signals is indicative of the concentration of one or more types of molecules within the user. The antenna includes two or more elements with a varying distance between them which reduces or eliminates power reflection and improves overall efficiency. The varying distance provides a first impedance at terminals of the antenna and a second impedance elsewhere on the antenna, such as midway along a long axis of the antenna. The first impedance matches an impedance of a transmitter output, a receiver input, or both. The second impedance results in the signal extending away from the antenna towards the user."

The inventors also observed increased transferrin receptor (TfR1) steady state levels and membrane TfR1 accumulation that they ascribed to impaired post-translational modification by palmitoylation as well as delayed transferrin recycling. Finally, the inventors showed that artesunate, dichloroacetate and Coenzyme-A improved TfR1 palmitoylation and thus represent candidate molecules for the treatment of patients with Friedreich ataxia. Thus the present invention relates to methods of treating Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) as well as to methods of predicting whether a patient suffering from FRDA will achieve a therapeutic response."

The non-immune cells translate the RNA and express the immunogen. Infiltrating immune cells respond to the RNA by expressing type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines which produce a local adjuvant effect which acts on the immunogen-expressing non-immune cells to upregulate major histocompatibility complex expression, thereby increasing presentation of the translated protein to T cells. The effects on the immune and non-immune cells can be achieved by a single delivery of a single RNA e.g., by a single injection."

A method for preparing a CAR-T cell includes: introducing the CAR into a T cell; and culturing the CAR-introduced T cell, and performing specific activation in the culture process. The preparation method can not only increase the proportion of CAR-positive T cells in the product, but also can achieve specific in vitro amplification of the Tcm subset in the CAR-positive T cells, and significantly increases the proportion of Tcm in a final product. Clinical trials show that the CAR-T cells have significantly improved amplification capacity in vivo, and improved clinical safety and effectiveness."

    "description": "A fluid sensing apparatus and method for detecting pressure and a presence of a bubble within a fluid tube. The fluid sensing apparatus comprises a housing configured to receive a portion of the fluid tube and to house a pressure sensor and an ultrasonic transmitter. The pressure sensor is positioned adjacent the fluid tube and is configured to receive a pressure sensor signal, which correlates to a detected pressure differential within the fluid tube. A controller transmits a drive signal to the ultrasonic transmitter, which emits ultrasonic waves through a portion of the fluid tube and to the pressure sensor. The pressure sensor receives both the ultrasonic waves and the pressure sensor signal, and subsequently transmits an output signal to the controller. In a presence of the detected pressure differential or the bubble within the fluid tube, the output signal will exhibit a DC shift or a distortion of signal characteristics of the output signal, respectively."

CGM data can be leveraged such that the missed meal bolus alert is only triggered when glucose levels rise in response to consuming the meal within the programmed time window. Therefore, the alert is only provided when a meal is actually consumed and no bolus has been delivered. This further allows the user to be alerted sooner, i.e., as soon as glucose levels rise a predetermined amount or passed a predetermined threshold indicating consumption of a meal as opposed to only at the end of the programmed window."

The active electrode is configured to be a cathode electrode located proximate to neural tissue of interest that is associated with a target region. The NS system includes an anode electrode and an electromagnetic interference (EMI) antenna. A control circuit is configured to control delivery of a NS therapy during a therapy delivery interval. The NS therapy is to be delivered between the anode electrode and the active electrode. The NS system develops a residual voltage between the anode electrode and the active electrode over the therapy delivery interval. A current regulator (CR) circuit is connected to the cathode electrode. The CR circuit is configured to control current flow through the cathode electrodes. During a discharge operation, the control circuit is configured to manage the CR circuit to control a discharge current flow over the discharge operation to discharge the residual voltage after therapy delivery in a manner that follows an actively emulated passive discharge (AEPD) profile. During the discharge operation, the CR circuit is connected to the inactive electrode. The CR circuit receives, as a first input, an EMI feedback signal from the EMI antenna. The CR circuit is configured to regulate the discharge current flow through the active electrode based on the EMI feedback signal, to maintain the AEPD profile over the discharge operation while in a presence of an EMI event."

A modified electron beam spatial distribution is employed to scan the x-ray target, such as a 2D periodic beam path, which advantageously lowers the temperature of the x-ray target compared to typical compact beam spatial distribution. As a result, the x-ray target can produce a high yield x-ray output without sacrificing the life span of the x-ray target. The use of a 2D periodic beam path allows a much colder x-ray target functioning regime such that more dosage can be applied in a short period of time compared to existing techniques."

    "description": "In a conventional flocculation and magnetic separation device, it was not possible to make the device downsized because the flocs are easily broken. In addition, there was no system for the ballast water treatment that is capable of simultaneous removal of plastics and microplastics drifting in the ocean. Furthermore, there were no ships and their navigation method capable of solving the pollution problem caused by plastics and microplastics floating in the ocean. By arranging a magnetic drum that rotates in a direction opposite to the flow of a fluid containing flocs and by changing the flow path by about 180 degrees or so immediately before contacting the magnetic drum, the flocs can be removed without breaking. This method can downsize the size of the magnetic drum with the required area reduced. By combining small-sized flocculation and magnetic separation device and a device that breaks and recovers floating plastics, it is possible to remove plastics and microplastics floating in the ocean at the same time. By taking into account the status of marine plastics in the ship's planned route information, it becomes possible to remove plastics and microplastics floating on the ocean by the ship."

Recapturing and reusing gas in an open environment reduces costs, rendering CSAM more commercially viable and efficient, and avoids risk of new damage to parts from contemporary pre-existing CSAM processes. A gas recovery nozzle attaches to a supersonic nozzle and sends used gas to a gas recovery sub-system by capturing gas that is deflected on impact with the part during CSAM. Captured gas is stored for reuse. A flexible coupling controls distance from the gas recovery nozzle to a part substrate to prevent (1) nozzle clogging; (2) stationary shock wave interference with gas flow; and (3) gas flow misdirection. The gas recovery nozzle also suppresses disruptive supersonic sounds. Implementations enable capture for later reuse of supersonically-propelled gas during in-situ CSAM in open environments."
