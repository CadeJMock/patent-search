By distributing the sensors over the indoor environment, the states and dynamics of the body of smoke and flame are monitored holistically (i.e. as a whole) even at the early stage of fire. Such information is useful to predict development of the fire. In one implementation, a sensor is held in an infrastructure sensor holder mounted on the ceiling during normal time. Upon detecting occurrence of fire, the sensor drops from the holder to land on the floor and orients a sensing direction vertically upward to perform monitoring."

    "description": "Microscopy with Ultraviolet Surface Excitation (MUSE) for use in the classroom to enhance life sciences education and curricula, or for other applications, including without limtiation the operating room, other medical environments, research environments, and low resource environments. MUSE's suitability is based on multiple key factors including its simplicity of use, the incorporation of inexpensive hardware including LED illumination, and very basic tissue preparation. The ultraviolet excitation acts as passive optical sectioning confining the generated fluorescence signal to only a few micrometers below the tissue surface thus eliminating the out of focus signals. This facilitates image capture of tissue microstructure and organization from specimens at the intact or sliced surface arising from varying fluorophore concentration within the different cellular compartments. Although just the tissue auto fluorescence maybe used, image quality is enhanced with brief application of nontoxic fluorescent dyes to selectively highlight cellular compartments. Sample preparation is safe, efficient and familiar to students with basic chemistry or biology lab experience. Mixed-dye powders may be used to simplify translation of this method for educational, medical, research, low resource, and other settings."

Phase differences are determined from the image data, and, in order to compensate for a systematic error present because of the lack of separation of the two transmitted signals, an error-compensated elevation angle and/or an error-compensated azimuth angle is determined by means of a compensation."

Non-ideal characteristics of the slow-scan mirror, including the mirror and related assembly, exhibit behaviors that impact the overall gain of the device, which changes over time and operating environment. To compensate for these non-ideal characteristics, the drive signal to the slow-scan mirror may need to be adjusted to achieve the desired beam deflection angle. An adaptive inner loop gain control structure may be employed to dynamically adjust the gain of the inner-control loop to achieve a target gain such that the overall gain variations from the slow scan mirror and other components are scan mirror such that compensated and stabilized. The parameters, logic and blocks of the inner loop gain control may be implemented in hardware, software, or combinations thereof."

Circuitry includes a ring cavity coupled to an input optical bus waveguide. The input optical bus waveguide receives an optical signal and passes the optical signal to the ring cavity. An electro-optical device, for instance a PN junction, is integrated within the ring cavity to modulate the optical signal such that an optical logic gate function is enabled. An output optical bus waveguide is also coupled to the ring cavity, which outputs the optical signal modified based on the optical logic gate function and based on a wavelength routing function. By using silicon nitride, the optical non-linearity of the materials enables an “all-optical” logic gate. Thus, the optical logic gate decision-making circuit is suitable for all-optical circuits, and support ultrafast optical signal processing and enabling packet switching of data."

    "description": "The present invention provides an image pickup device that recognizes the object that the user is attempting to capture as the subject, tracks the movement of that subject, and can continue tracking the movement of the subject even when the subject leaves the capturing area so that the subject can always be reliably brought into focus. The image pickup device includes a main camera that captures the subject; an EVF that displays the captured image captured by the main camera, a sub-camera that captures the subject using a wider capturing region than the main camera, and a processing unit that extracts the subject from the captured images captured by the main camera and the sub-camera, tracks the extracted subject, and brings the subject into focus when an image of the subject is actually captured. When the subject moves outside of a capturing region of the main camera, the processing unit tracks the subject extracted from the captured image captured by the sub-camera."

By using a eutectic point of catalyst particles and silicon, and a driving factor that the Gibbs free energy of amorphous silicon is greater than that of crystalline silicon, and due to absorption of the amorphous silicon by the molten catalyst particles to form a supersaturated silicon eutectoid, the silicon nucleates and grows into silicon-based nanowires. Moreover, during the growth of the silicon-based nanowire, the amorphous silicon film grows linearly along guide slots under the action of the catalyst particles, and reverse growth of the silicon-based nanowire is restricted by the retaining walls, thus obtaining silicon-based nanowires with a high density and high uniformity. Furthermore, by controlling the size of the catalyst particles and the thickness of the amorphous silicon film, the width of the silicon-based nanowire may also be controlled."

So far, these degradation processes were usually described by mechanistic models or simple empirical prediction models. In order to accurately predict IAP, data-driven models are proposed, comparing some traditional stateless models (linear and kernel ridge regression, as well as feed-forward neural networks) to more complex stateful recurrent neural networks (echo state networks and long short-term memory networks). Additionally, variations of the stateful models are discussed. In particular, stateful models using mechanistical pre-knowledge about the degradation dynamics (hybrid models). Stateful models and their variations may be more suitable for generating near perfect predictions when they are trained on a large enough dataset, while hybrid models may be more suitable for generalizing better given smaller datasets with changing conditions."

    "description": "To determine a path through a pose configuration space, trajectories of poses may be evaluated in parallel based at least on translating the trajectories along at least one axis of the pose configuration space (e.g., an orientation axis). A trajectory may include at least a portion of a turn having a fixed turn radius. Turns or turn portions that have the same turn radius and initial orientation can be translatively shifted along and processed in parallel along the orientation axis as they are translated copies of each other, but with different starting points. Trajectories may be evaluated based at least on processing variables used to evaluate reachability as bit vectors with threads effectively performing large vector operations in synchronization. A parallel reduction pattern may be used to account for dependencies that may exist between sections of a trajectory for evaluating reachability, allowing for the sections to be processed in parallel."

For example, the systems and methods of the present disclosure can be included in or otherwise leveraged by an autonomous vehicle. In one example, a computing system can extract one or more relevant portions from imagery, where the relevant portions are less than an entirety of the imagery. The computing system can provide the relevant portions of the imagery to a machine-learned convolutional neural network and receive at least one prediction from the machine-learned convolutional neural network based at least in part on the one or more relevant portions of the imagery. Thus, the computing system can skip performing convolutions over regions of the imagery where the imagery is sparse and/or regions of the imagery that are not relevant to the prediction being sought."

The time offsets may be communicated by the computing devices to remote devices communicatively coupled to the computing device via a first communication network. The remote devices may adjust locally maintained application clocks based on the time offset. The adjustment may synchronize the local application clock with the precision timing signal of a second communication network. In response, a remote device may communicatively couple with the second communication network."

    "description": "In a time synchronization method, after clock board times between service boards are synchronized, a service board obtains a CPU time and the clock board time of the service board according to a preset periodicity, and makes a record. When performing CPU time synchronization between the service boards, the service board obtains a current CPU time of the service board, calculates a synchronization time of the CPU based on the current CPU time, a last recorded CPU time and clock board time, and adjusts the CPU time of the service board to the synchronization time. After the clock board times between the service boards that need to implement CPU high-precision time synchronization are synchronized by using a high-precision time synchronization protocol, the CPU time of each service board is adjusted to a corresponding synchronization time."

    "description": "A register reading method and apparatus, a device and a medium. After a server is crashed, a CPU-register collecting request is triggered. Different types of CPUs correspond to different types and quantities of registers that require data collection. Therefore, by firstly determining the register required to be read corresponding to the CPU type, and determining the reading mode of the register, the disadvantage that the reading mode that may merely use a single instruction may not satisfy the demand on field crashing analysis is prevented. Subsequently, by using a PECI bus, the register data of a plurality of registers are read. By collecting the registers of the CPU directly by using the PECI bus, the problem that the performance excessively relies on the stability of the ME due to the intermediate transfer via the ME is prevented, which greatly increases the reading success rate of the registers."

The preparation of the reserved memory part is performed off-line in a manner that is isolated from the current user of the active memory part. Preparation of memory includes erasure of data, reconfiguration, etc. The memory restoration system allows for simple exchange of the reserved memory part, once the active memory part is returned. The previously active memory may be concurrently recycled for future reuse in this same manner to become a reserved memory. This enables the computing collection infrastructure to “swap” to what was previously the inactive memory part when a user vacates a server, speeding up the server wipe process."

A transmitter of requests can be authorized to transmit a request responsive to possession of a credit corresponding to the communication request. In these situations, if the transmitter has exhausted a supply of credits, the transmitter waits until a credit is returned before transmitting another request. The receiver of the requests can manage credit returns based on whether a request queue has space to receive another request. Further, the receiver can delay a credit return based on how many requests are pending at the receiver, even if space is available in the request queue. This delay can prevent an oversupply of requests from developing downstream of the request queue. Latency, for instance, can be improved by managing the presence of requests that are downstream."

Page servers perform pushdown operations based on specific, and specifically formatted or generated, information, instructions, and data provided thereto from a compute node. Page servers also determine that page splits have occurred during reading of data pages maintained by page servers during pushdown operations, and also during fulfillment of compute node data requests. To detect a data page has split, page servers utilize information from a compute node of an expected next data page which is compared to a next data page in the page server page index. A mismatch in the comparison by page servers indicates data page was split. Compute nodes and page servers store and maintain off-row data generated during data operations via page affinity considerations where the off-row data is stored at the same page server as the data."

During operation, the system receives training data comprising observations for a set of time-series signals gathered from sensors in a monitored system during normal fault-free operation. Next, the system divides the observations into N subgroups comprising non-overlapping time windows of observations. The system then selects observations with a local minimum value and a local maximum value for all signals from each subgroup to be training vectors for the inferential model. Finally, the system trains the inferential model using the selected training vectors. Note that by selecting observations with local minimum and maximum values to be training vectors, the system maximizes an operational range for the training vectors, which reduces clipping in estimates subsequently produced by the inferential model and thereby reduces false alarms."
