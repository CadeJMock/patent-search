Rather than re-transmit the same frame multiple times, the GPU instructs the display control module to replay a previously-transmitted frame. During a refresh cycle in which the display control module is replaying captured content, the GPU omits accessing memory to retrieve and resend the frame that is being replayed, and instead sends only invalid data and GPU timing information so that the display control module remains synchronized with the GPU."

    "description": "Audio signals of speech may be processed using an acoustic model. An acoustic model may be implemented with multiple streams of processing where different streams perform processing using different dilation rates. For example, a first stream may process features of the audio signal with one or more convolutional neural network layers having a first dilation rate, and a second stream may process features of the audio signal with one or more convolutional neural network layers having a second dilation rate. Each stream may compute a stream vector, and the stream vectors may be combined to a vector of speech unit scores, where the vector of speech unit scores provides information about the acoustic content of the audio signal. The vector of speech unit scores may be used for any appropriate application of speech, such as automatic speech recognition."

A voice command received by a locked device is stored, a prompt requesting that the device be unlocked is generated, and the voice command is processed automatically after the device is unlocked. Thus, the system processes the voice command without the user repeating the voice command. In addition, the system may process certain voice commands even when the device is locked. For example, a whitelist filter compares an intent associated with the voice command to whitelisted intents from a whitelist database before the intent is dispatched to a speechlet, and intents included in the whitelist database are processed normally. Thus, the system performs certain voice commands while the device is locked, while other voice commands may be automatically processed after the device is unlocked without the user repeating the voice command."

    "description": "Tunneling Field Effect Transistors (TFETs) are promising devices in that they promise significant performance increase and energy consumption decrease due to a steeper subthreshold slope (for example, smaller sub-threshold swing). In various embodiments, vertical fin-based TFETs can be fabricated in trenches, for example, silicon trenches. In another embodiment, vertical TFETs can be used on different material systems acting as a substrate and/or trenches (for example, Si, Ge, III-V semiconductors, GaN, and the like). In one embodiment, the tunneling direction in the channel of the vertical TFET can be perpendicular to the Si substrates. In one embodiment, this can be different than the tunneling direction in the channel of lateral TFETs."

An ordered array of differing polarization domains in the multiferroic layer produces corresponding domains having differing properties in the two-dimensional material. When the multiferroic layer is ferroelectric, the ferroelectric polarization domains in the layer produce local electric fields that penetrate the two-dimensional material. The local electric fields modulate the charge carriers and carrier density on a nanometer length scale, resulting in the formation of lateral p-n or p-i-n junctions, and variations thereof appropriate for device functions."

The rough buffer layer overlies a silicon substrate, a buffer structure overlies the rough buffer layer, and a heterojunction structure overlies the buffer structure. The buffer structure causes band bending and formation of a two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) in the rough buffer layer. The rough buffer layer includes silicon or some other suitable semiconductor material and, in some embodiments, is doped. A top surface of the rough buffer layer and/or a bottom surface of the rough buffer layer is/are rough to promote carrier scattering along the top and bottom surfaces. The carrier scattering reduces carrier mobility and increases resistance at the 2DHG. The increased resistance increases an overall resistance of the silicon substrate, which reduces substrate loses and increases a power added efficiency (PAE)."

Radiation-induced leakage currents in parasitic field oxide transistors are reduced by spacing diffusions away from field oxide edges under the gate, forming gap regions from which n-type dopants and silicide formation are excluded using blocking patterns in the layout. P-type implants along these field oxide edges further increase radiation tolerance. Dimensions can be tailored to permit tradeoffs between radiation tolerance, breakdown voltage, and circuit density. Compact layouts for series-connected NMOS transistors are provided and applied to high-density rad-hard circuits. Methods for fabricating devices having these features are also provided, requiring minimal adaptation of standard processes. These designs and processes allow a mix of integrated circuits having differing levels of tolerance to total ionizing dose on the same semiconductor wafer."
