Based on a determination that the cryptographic-function constraints do not include mandatory cryptographic computing resource requirements, first resource-scaling operations are performed that include an analysis of cryptographic metrics associated with a processor. The cryptographic metrics include information associated with the encrypted message, along with performance measurements of cryptographic functions performed by the processor. The cryptographic-function constraints and results of the analysis of the cryptographic metrics are used to determine cryptographic processing requirements of the encrypted message; and match the cryptographic processing requirements to selected ones of a set of cryptographic computing resources to identify a customized set of cryptographic computing resources matched to cryptographic processing requirements of the encrypted message. The customized set of cryptographic computing resources is used to perform customized cryptographic functions on the encrypted message."

    "description": "A system and method for defense against cache timing channel attacks using cache management hardware is provided. Sensitive information leakage is a growing security concern exacerbated by shared hardware structures in computer processors. Recent studies have shown how adversaries can exploit cache timing channel attacks to exfiltrate secret information. To effectively guard computing systems against such attacks, embodiments disclosed herein provide practical defense techniques that are readily deployable and introduce only minimal performance overhead. In this regard, a new protection framework against cache timing channel attacks is provided herein by leveraging commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware support in processor caches, including last level caches (LLC), for cache monitoring and partitioning. This framework applies signal processing techniques on per-domain cache occupancy data to identify suspicious application contexts. Dynamic way partitioning is then used to disband domains that are involved in timing channels"

    "description": "The present disclosure presents various systems and methods for implementing a physical unclonable function device. One such method comprises providing an integrated circuit having a plurality of set/reset flip flop logic circuits, wherein each of the set/reset flip flop logic circuits enters a metastable state for a particular input sequence. The method includes varying circuit parameters for each of the plurality of set/reset flip flop logic circuits to account for manufacturing variations in the set/reset flip flop logic circuits and enable generating a stable but random output in response to the particular input sequence. Thus, by applying the particular input sequence to the integrated circuit, a unique identifier for the integrated circuit can be derived from an output response of the plurality of set/reset flip flop logic circuits."

These data blocks arrive and are stored in an input buffer in the order they were stored in memory (or other known order)—typically sequentially according to memory address (i.e., in-order.) The processor waits until a certain number of data blocks are available in the input buffer and then randomly selects blocks from the input buffer for processing. This randomizes the processing order of the data blocks. The processing order of data blocks may be randomized within sets of data blocks associated with a single read transaction, or across sets of data blocks associated with multiple read transactions."

The position and/or an applied force can be determined using time-of-flight (TOF) techniques, for example. Acoustic touch sensing can utilize transducers (e.g., piezoelectric) to simultaneously transmit ultrasonic waves along a surface and through a thickness of a deformable material. The location of the object and the applied force can be determined based on the amount of time elapsing between the transmission of the waves and receipt of the reflected waves. In some examples, an acoustic touch sensing system can be insensitive to water contact on the device surface, and thus acoustic touch sensing can be used for touch sensing in devices that may become wet or fully submerged in water."

The ratio of the first XOR element to the capacity of the first memory device is substantially smaller than the ratio of the second XOR element to the capacity of the second memory device. A read verify operation to find program failures is executed on either a wordline to wordline basis, an erase block to erase block basis, or both a wordline to wordline basis and an erase block to erase block basis. Because the program failures are found and fixed prior to programming to the second memory device, the second XOR element may be decreased substantially."

Latency of executing the write operations is improved because the write operations can be responded back to clients as complete once logged within the journal without having to store the data to higher latency disk storage. If there is a failure, then a replay process is performed to replay the write operations logged within the journal in order to bring a file system up-to-date. The time to complete the replay of the write operations is significantly reduced by caching metadata (e.g., indirect blocks, checksums, buftree identifiers, file block numbers, and consistency point counts) directly into log records. Replay can quickly access this metadata for replaying the write operations because the metadata does not need to be retrieved from the higher latency disk storage into memory."

    "description": "A method for managing memory for applications in a computing system includes receiving a selection of a preferred application. During user-controlled operation over the application, the transitions of selected application between foreground and background are monitored. A retention of the application in memory is triggered upon a transition of the application to background during the user operation. Retention of the application includes compressing memory portions of the application. Accordingly, the application is retained within the memory based on said compressed memory portions. A requirement to restore the retained application is sensed based on either a user selection or an automatically generated prediction and the application is restored from the retained state back to the foreground."

    "description": "A method for detecting network anomalies includes receiving a control message from a cellular network and extracting one or more features from the control message. The method also includes predicting a potential label for the control message using a predictive model configured to receive the one or more extracted features from the control message as feature inputs. Here, the predictive model is trained on a set of training control messages where each training control message includes one or more corresponding features and an actual label. The method further includes determining that a probability of the potential label satisfies a confidence threshold. The method also includes analyzing the control message to determine whether the control message corresponds to a respective network performance issue. When the control message impacts network performance, the method includes communicating the network performance issue to a network entity responsible for the network performance issue."

Subsequently, the stylization application generates a second design based on the style score, where the second design is more representative of the target style than the first design. Advantageously, because the stylization application can substantially increase the number of designs that can be generated based on the target style in a given amount of time, relative to more manual prior art techniques, the overall quality of the design ultimately selected for production can be improved."

In particular, the platform trains this machine learning model according to an algorithm suited for training with sparse amounts of data, e.g., a temporal difference learning algorithm. In contrast, the platform uses different models, trained according to different algorithms than the low-impression keyword model, to generate bids for keywords determined not to be low-impression keywords. Once the low-impression keyword model is trained offline, the platform deploys the model for use online to generate actual bids for the low-impression keywords and submits them to the search engine.

    "description": "A contrast ratio color picker system is described that generates, based on a selected color, a contrast ratio color picker that presents a filtered palette of colors satisfying a contrast ratio threshold, relative to the selected color. To do so, the contrast ratio color picker system computes a relative luminance value for the selected color and identifies a contrast ratio threshold for the digital content. The contrast ratio color picker system then selects a palette from a target color space and generates a filtered palette by masking pixels displaying colors of the target color space palette that fail to satisfy the contrast ratio threshold. The filtered palette is then output as part of the contrast ratio color picker, which enables application of colors selected from the filtered palette to digital content."

A control, responsive to processing of frames of image data captured by the camera and during a calibration maneuver by the vehicle, determines an initial trailer template of trailer hitched to the vehicle. During a turning portion of the calibration maneuver, a subset of frames of image data is stored, each stored frame of image data including the trailer at a different trailer angle relative to a longitudinal axis of the vehicle. The control, responsive to storing the subset of frames of image data, converts each stored frame of image data to an edge image and matches each edge image to the determined initial trailer template, and determines a location of a hitch ball of the vehicle."

The Federated Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (FTD3) algorithm is proposed to connect the federated learning (FL) module and the reinforcement learning (RL) module. The FTD3 algorithm transmits only neural network parameters instead of vehicle samples to protect privacy. Firstly, FTD3 selects only specific networks for aggregation to reduce the communication cost. Secondly, FTD3 realizes the deep combination of FL and RL by aggregating target critic networks with smaller Q-values. Thirdly, RSU neural network participates in aggregation rather than training, and only shared global model parameters are used."
