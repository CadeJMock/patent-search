A time-dispersive channel can be transformed into a frequency-flat channel by means of the path-based ZF beamforming and delay alignment modulation. The present invention further proposes a channel equalization-free single-carrier broadband transmission system. In the present invention, with delay alignment modulation and the path-based beamforming, the issue of inter-symbol interference in broadband communications is resolved, without requiring the channel equalization or multi-carrier transmission, thereby achieving the low-complexity single-carrier broadband communication."

The UE may determine one or more of a time offset value, a precoder cycling granularity value, and a precoding matrix indicator (PMI) for a channel state information (CSI) report, and generate CQI accordingly. Additionally, the UE may include the determined values in the CSI report to indicate the transmission scheme used for the CQI derivation. Based on the CQI, the base station can then determine the transmission scheme and perform link adaption accordingly."

    "description": "Systems, methods, and instrumentalities (e.g. aspects of entities, interfaces and procedures in a wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU) and/or network layers L1, L2, l3) are disclosed for low latency medium access control (MAC) protocol data unit (PDU) assembly in wireless systems, such as 5G flexible radio access technology (RAT) (5gFLEX). Latency may be reduced, for example, by WTRU determination of network transmission parameters and signaling prior to a transmission grant. A WTRU may receive a modulation and coding scheme (MCS), resource range, etc. prior to a grant, e.g., for use in future grants. Data blocks may be incrementally created/encoded prior to a grant. Data units may be segmented, assembled and multiplexed, for example, based on data block sizes that allow MAC and radio link control (RLC) processing prior to a grant. Flexible grant sizes may be provided for early generation of transport blocks before a grant. A minimum guaranteed transport block size (TBS) may be signaled to permit early generation of a MAC PDU. Transmission parameters may be selected prior to a grant, for example, using blind decoding or a DCI reception procedure."

    "description": "This application describes a link bit error-based processing method and apparatus. A network device may report, to a controller, a bit error rate at which an egress port on the network device is configured to send data traffic. In this way, the controller may collect and accumulate bit error rates at which data traffic is sent through all egress ports on a transmission path, to obtain an accumulated bit error rate of the transmission path. In this way, the controller may determine, based on the accumulated bit error rate of the transmission path, whether to switch a service flow on the transmission path to another transmission path. Therefore, the controller may switch a service flow transmitted on a transmission path with an excessively high accumulated bit error rate to another transmission path with a relatively low accumulated bit error rate for transmission."

    "description": "Technologies to improve throughput in wireless multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) and single-input-single-output (SISO) systems are described. A first device includes a baseband processor with an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) circuitry that uses a digital multi-carrier modulation scheme that defines a set of data subcarriers, a set of pilot subcarriers, and a direct current (DC) subcarrier to communicate data in a wireless channel between the first device and a second device. The baseband processor also includes subcarrier pre-equalization logic that receives, from the second device, feedback data indicative of a frequency selective fading characteristic of the wireless channel and adjusts a first amplitude value of a subset of the set of data subcarriers to a second amplitude value. Adjusting the first amplitude value to the second amplitude value reduces the frequency selective fading characteristic of the wireless channel."

When a network device detects that a neighbor (or “peer”) device has acquired an IP address or has been configured by a network controller, then the port on which the neighbor device is detected can then be transitioned from the initialization mode into a forwarding mode. In the forwarding mode, the port can be used to transmit packets to obtain an IP address. Thus, the network devices are converted from an L2 device to an L3 device in a hierarchical order such that upstream devices are discovered and converted into L3 devices before downstream devices."

    "description": "A permissioned blockchain, using off-chain storage, provides advantages over blockchains that rely on consensus and/or store information within the blockchain. Advantages include enhanced viability, compactness, and the ability to register material with distribution limitations (e.g., military classified). Examples create an immutable public record of data signatures that confirm when data is intact, without distributing the data itself, so that widespread availability of the blockchain (beyond those privileged to see the data) advantageously increases the size of the community that is able to detect spoofing or forgery attempts. A permissioning entity limits submissions to manage blockchain growth, foreclosing problematic material that may risk long-term viability. Examples render blockchain operations resistant to advanced persistent threats (APTs), leverage digital signatures as additional trust elements for high-risk data, link records to track pedigree and enable identification of superseded (obsolete) data, and leverage out-of-band date proof to enable independent verification of integrity and no-later-than data-of-existence."

Directional modes are recovered by filling pixel locations in the prediction unit with samples from the portion of the unit that is determined to have samples available for use using a counterpart directional mode to the one that is useless. When it is determined that reference samples are missing for a particular prediction unit or portion thereof given a particular directional mode, a determination is made about whether reference samples along another portion of the prediction unit are available. The other portion is the side of the prediction unit at an opposite end of the particular directional mode. When it is determined that such reference samples are available, it is possible to extend the number of intra directional modes by replacing the particular directional modes that are rendered useless, because of the unavailability of reference samples, with their counterpart directional modes that are oppositely directed."

This system allows entities to deliver low latency live video streams from cameras mounted on the spacecraft, as well as other satellites, and on the surface of the Moon and planets. The latency will depend on the communication technology used and the distance of the video source from Earth. The lowest latency can be achieved by using optical communication technology, such as laser communication. The system can distribute live streams originating in space to a large global audience through an earth-based distribution network and can support millions of concurrent online users with near real-time latency."

Each segment's optical profile corresponds to characteristics of optical signals delivered over the segment (e.g., attenuation, changes in frequencies, changes in power outputs, etc.). The differences between the segments' drift(s) over time are utilized to determine the source of a degradation within the PON, and may be utilized to identify a particular component of the segment (e.g., the OLT, the last mile termination unit, or an optical fiber included in the segment) as being the source of the degradation."

The noise-cancellation system uses reference signal from a reference sensor, such as an accelerometer, to generate a noise-cancellation signal to destructively interfere with road noise in the vehicle cabin. A first set of entertainment audio thresholds triggers the system to enable or disable adaptation of an adaptive filter of the noise-cancellation system. A second set of entertainment audio thresholds triggers the system to enable, attenuate, or disable the noise-cancellation signal. As the entertainment audio increases, the system first disables the adaptation of the adaptive filter, then attenuates the noise-cancellation signal, then completely disables the noise-cancellation signal. Conversely, as the entertainment audio decreases, the system first enables the noise-cancellation signal, then reduces the attenuation (thereby increasing the amplitude) of the noise-cancellation signal, and then enables the adaptation of the adaptive filter."
