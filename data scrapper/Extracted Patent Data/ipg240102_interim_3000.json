    "description": "A crossover prevention valve for use in a multi-component fluid mixing and dispensing system includes a valve body defining at least two fluid passageways having respective one-way check valves at their outlet ends. A forward end of the valve body cooperates with an interior surface of a dispensing nozzle to define a mixing chamber for chemically reactive fluids prior to discharging the mixed fluids out of the dispensing nozzle. The crossover prevention valve does not permit reverse flow, thereby preventing clogs due to undesired intrusion of one reactant into the flow path of another reactant. Solidified reactants left in the mixing chamber are easily removed from the valve body, permitting the valve body to be reused even after sitting for extended periods."

For example, the device may stop to avoid collision with an object, upon determining a failure of an internal component, upon receipt of a command, and so forth. Responsive to a signal to stop, the motor is disconnected from the battery. A braking circuit is activated that dissipates, in a controlled fashion, power produced by continuing motion of the motor. When the voltage produced by the motor's continuing motion drops below a threshold, a stop circuit shorts the terminals of the motor, causing the motor to resist further rotation. When the stop condition no longer applies the signal to stop is removed resulting in the motor being reconnected to the battery, the braking circuit being deactivated, the stop circuit opens the short between the terminals of the motor, and normal operation resumes."

The quality system for Additive Manufacturing is capable of measuring true in-process state variables associated with an additive manufacturing process, i.e., those in-process variables that define a feasible process space within which the process is deemed nominal. The in-process state variables can also be correlated to the part structure or microstructure and can then be useful in identifying particular locations within the part likely to include defects."

In general, a vapor of a first fluid may be directed to a layer of a powder spread across a build volume. The vapor may condense to reduce mobility of the particles of the powder of the layer. For example, the condensing vapor may reduce the likelihood of particle ejection from the layer and, thus, may reduce the likelihood of clogging or otherwise degrading a printhead used to jet a second fluid (e.g., a binder) to the layer. Further, or instead, the condensing vapor may increase the density of the powder in the layer which, when repeated over a plurality of layers forming a three-dimensional object, may reduce the likelihood of slumping of the part during sintering."

    "description": "Methods for forming multi-layer substrates including top and bottom surface layers and a melt softened thermoplastic material layer between the exterior surface layers, where the thermoplastic material includes polyethylene or has a tan delta value of 0.2 to 0.4 within the temperature range of 100° F.-350° F. The 3 (or more) layers are assembled, and heated, melt softening the thermoplastic material, causing bonding of the thermoplastic layer to the exterior surface layers. A cleaning composition may be loaded onto the multi-layer substrate, where a fluid pathway through the melted thermoplastic material allows the cleaning composition to travel between the surface layers. Adhesion between the surface layers and the thermoplastic layer is provided by the thermoplastic material itself, which bonds to groups of fibers in the surface layers. The process does not require chemical adhesives, any processing water, drying, or the like, so as to be possible with low capital investment."

A processor determines an effective tire inflation pressure based on the generated signals and further at least on a calculated moving average of the ambient temperature (e.g., over a defined time period such as 24 hours) and generates real time notifications associated with the determined effective tire inflation pressure to specified user interfaces. At least one sensor may be an inflation pressure sensor configured to generate event-based signals corresponding to detected changes per unit pressure. The processor may further generate real time feedback control signals to an automatic tire inflation device, based on the determined effective tire inflation pressure, or enable and prompt manual control of the tire inflation device via the user interface."

Typically this means that there is no feasible method to lift the battery to disengage it from the vehicle or to operate any engagement catches or locks etc. The disclosure provides a roller arrangement which has no translation or actuator requirements in order to allow the battery to have reduced frictional engagement with the battery compartment during installation or removal, and also to be well engaged with the battery compartment once installed. Rollers are provided which drop into recesses in the battery compartment at which point they are removed from load bearing engagement and thus, the recesses serve to locate the battery into the installed state in the compartment."

    "description": "An operator offset request for automatic lane following system of an automobile vehicle includes an operator offset request defining a lateral offset distance away from a first travel-line of an automobile vehicle in a displacement path moved until a second travel-line of the automobile is achieved. An operator input setting system when actuated generates an initiation signal forwarded to a controller to input the operator offset request. An achievement signal is generated to signify a selected offset position selected by a vehicle operator for the offset distance is achieved. A vehicle return travel path is elected by the vehicle operator to return the automobile vehicle to the first travel-line from the second travel-line by a return displacement path which is opposite to the displacement path."

The traveling environment recognizer recognizes travel lane sides of dividing lines defining a travel lane as two approximate lines each in a linear form based on the image data on a traveling environment acquired by the external environment recognizer. When a static three-dimensional object has been continuously detected on or near one of dividing lines based on the image data, the processor sets a virtual approximate line by correcting the lateral position of the approximate line of the one of the dividing lines in a direction apart from the static three-dimensional object toward the middle of the travel lane by a predetermined correction amount, and sets a target travel course in the middle between the virtual approximate line and the approximate line of the other of the dividing lines."

Two matching motor-driven propellers are correspondingly positioned at or near the wingtips. A computer receives sensory motion inputs and transmits sequential commands that continually adjust the respective propulsive forces of the wingtip propellers by effecting equal and opposite changes in their respective rotational speeds. An increase in one wingtip propeller's rotational speed is concomitant a decrease in the other wingtip propeller's rotational speed, wherein the increase and the decrease are of the same magnitude. The seaplane rolls upward on the wing whose wingtip propeller is increasing in rotational speed. Control of the seaplane's rolling motion is thus enabled by a sustained propulsive equilibrium between the two wingtip propellers."

The propeller noise may be noise that is generated during normal operation of one or more propellers. The propeller noise emitted by the propellers of the aerial vehicle propagates into the environment around the aerial vehicle and reflects off any objects within the environment. Because the noise generated by each propeller is distinguishable, sets of solutions (distance and all directions) may be computed for each propeller. The intersections of those sets of solutions is representative of the actual distance and direction of the object with respect to the aerial vehicle."

Firstly, a system optimization objective is constructed; and in a uplink communication network of a single UAV and ground sensors, the UAV receives data periodically. Secondly, according to a constructed optimization problem, the optimization objective is maximization of EE({W},{t},{S}). Finally, an original problem is decomposed into two approximate concave-convex fractional sub-problem based on a block coordinate descent method and a successive convex approximation technique to obtain a suboptimal solution; an overall iterative algorithm is proposed: in each iteration, by solving the sub-problems, wake-up scheduling S, time slot t and UAV trajectory W are alternately optimized. The solution obtained in each iteration is used as the input of next iteration. The present invention can jointly optimize the UAV flight trajectory, the sensor wake-up scheduling and the flight time slot to ensure that the transmission information amount and energy consumption of the sensors satisfy system requirements, while maximizing the energy efficiency of the system."

To this end, a technique is described for image-space based motion planning. In an embodiment, a planned 3D trajectory is projected into an image-space of an image captured by the autonomous vehicle. The planned 3D trajectory is then optimized according to a cost function derived from information (e.g., depth estimates) in the captured image. The cost function associates higher cost values with identified regions of the captured image that are associated with areas of the physical environment into which travel is risky or otherwise undesirable. The autonomous vehicle is thereby encouraged to avoid these areas while satisfying other motion planning objectives."

    "description": "A method for producing a satellite to facilitate the inclusion of one or more reflector antennas on a surface of the satellite is disclosed. A reusable generic configuration is determined in advance separately from the satellite mission. The generic configuration generally features the following parameters for each reflector: diameter, focal distance, offset distance of the reflector in the deployed position, position of the deployment device, position of the radiofrequency source. The generic configuration is determined such that an antenna points by default towards the centre of the earth when its reflector is in a deployed position. A specific configuration step then consists of defining a limited number of specific parameters depending on the satellite mission. The specific configuration is rendered possible in particular by controlling the deployment device, i.e., by changing the direction in which the antenna points, once the reflector has been deployed."

The bifunctional small molecules, generally referred to as ARM-HI's, function through orthogonal pathways, by inhibiting the gp120-CD4 interaction, and by recruiting anti-DNP antibodies to gp120-expressing cells, thereby preventing cell infection and spread of HIV. It has been shown that ARM-HI's bind to gp120 and gp-120 expressing cells competitively with CD4, thereby decreasing viral infectivity as shown by an MT-2 cell assay, the binding leading to formation of a ternary complex by recruiting anti-DNP antibodies to bind thereto, the antibodies present in the ternary complex promoting the complement-dependent destruction of the gp120-expressing cells. Compounds and methods are described herein."
