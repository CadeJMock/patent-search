The rolling circle amplification reaction generates concatemers containing tandem copies of a sequence of interest and at least one universal adaptor sequence. An increase in the number of tandem copies in a given concatemer increases the number of sites along the concatemer for hybridizing to multiple sequencing primers which serve as multiple initiation sites for polymerase-catalyzed sequencing reactions. When the sequencing reaction employs detectably labeled nucleotides and/or detectably labeled multivalent molecules (e.g., having nucleotide units), the signals emitted by the nucleotides or nucleotide units that participate in the parallel sequencing reactions along the concatemer yields an increased signal intensity for each concatemer."

The grid control system receives the data and associates specific data with specific columns in an array—the “grid.” The grid control system compares the actual positions of the columns in the grid to target positions that were determined based on the requirements of the structure to be supported. After determining differences between the actual positions and the target positions, the grid control system sends instructions to column positioning tools associated with the individual columns. Actuators in a column positioning tool are directed by the grid control system to adjust the position of the associated column. Once the live streamed data confirms that each column is in the proper position, the columns are fixed in place."

The brake shoe has a receptacle that receives and retains the shaped head of the ribbon spring, therein interconnecting the ribbon spring to the brake shoe. A cam is supported within the brake shoe. The brake shoe expands when the cam is turned. This causes the protrusion on the brake shoe to be biased against the flexible tab in the ribbon spring. This, in turn, causes the flexible tab to flex and extend away from the ribbon spring at an inclined angle. Within the guide track of the tilt-in window, the extended flexible tab acts as a barb and engages the side wall of the guide track.

Heat from the solid medium is delivered continuously on demand. An array of bricks incorporating internal radiation cavities is directly heated by thermal radiation. The cavities facilitate rapid, uniform heating via reradiation. Heat delivery via flowing gas establishes a thermocline which maintains high outlet temperature throughout discharge. Gas flows through structured pathways within the array, delivering heat which may be used for processes including calcination, hydrogen electrolysis, steam generation, and thermal power generation and cogeneration. Groups of thermal storage arrays may be controlled and operated at high temperatures without thermal runaway via deep-discharge sequencing. Forecast-based control enables continuous, year-round heat supply using current and advance information of weather and VRE availability. High-voltage DC power conversion and distribution circuitry improves the efficiency of VRE power transfer into the system."

Such a vibratory plate is complicated. It is proposed to use a free-piston engine with one piston as the engine for a vibratory plate. In this free piston engine, the piston moves reciprocally, and the cylinder performs reciprocating movements opposite to the movements of the piston. The cylinder is mounted vertically and fixed to the plate. In each engine cycle the gas pressure acts on the piston and cylinder. After combustion, the piston moves up and the cylinder moves down. Since the cylinder is fixed to the plate, it also moves downward and compacts soil, gravel, etc."

    "description": "A system for multiple burns from a solid fuel rocket motor may extinguish rocket fuel after the rocket has been ignited. The motor may be extinguished via rapid decompression of the combustion chamber. The fuel may then be reignited by a suitable igniter, and the process of extinguishing and reigniting may be repeated, enabling multi-burn maneuvers. A decompressive extinguishing plug nozzle may extinguish solid rocket fuel after the rocket has been ignited and/or keep a rocket in a disarmed (zero thrust) state until the rocket is to be armed. The nozzle may include a plug that mostly impedes the opening of the nozzle and an outer cowl that is movable to rapidly decompress the combustion chamber. This rapid decompression extinguishes the solid rocket fuel. In some aspects, the fuel can be reignited and extinguished multiple times."

    "description": "The present disclosure is an electromagnetic force control method of a magnetic disk type negative stiffness electromagnetic actuator. The present disclosure relates to the technical field of vibration control. According to the actually required static bearing capacity, the present disclosure determines the positive stiffness k of a mechanical spring required for a magnetic disk type quasi-zero stiffness vibration isolator; and establishes an electromagnetic force mathematical model of a single electromagnet under a condition of magnetic unsaturation. The present disclosure aims at the magnetic disk type quasi-zero stiffness vibration isolator and takes the coil current as an input control variable, so that the electromagnetic force and displacement of the negative stiffness electromagnetic actuator have a linear relationship, thereby changing the non-linear nature of a vibration isolation system, avoiding the multi-stable phenomenon caused by the non-linear electromagnetic force during working, and eliminating complex dynamic behaviors such as jumping when the whole vibration isolator works. Complex sensors and control systems are not needed, and implementation manners are simple and convenient."

Confined combustion environments are prone to large amplitude pressure oscillations known as thermoacoustic instabilities. Although several techniques have been employed to control or mitigate such instabilities, optimization of these methods is achieved at the cost of performing multiple trial and error experiments/simulations. This invention develops a methodology to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics using synchronization, recurrence, and fractal measures and find the coherent region in such turbulent flow field. Such an analysis provides us with a novel way to detect critical regions responsible for thermoacoustic instability, and other oscillatory instabilities in general, in the flow field and implement an optimized control strategy at these regions."

    "description": "A micro-combined heat and power (mCHP) system includes a liquid cooled variable speed genset that is located to the exterior of a building and that is provides heat and power to the interior of the building. The genset may be configured to output an electrical supply of between approximately between 500W and 40 kW. A coolant loop may extend from the exterior genset to the interior of a building and is configured to reclaim heat from one or more sources of waste heat at the engine, generator, oil and/or exhaust. The reclaimed heat is then transferred, directly or indirectly, to the air flow path of a building heating system. In one embodiment, the reclaimed heat is transferred to a liquid circuit via a liquid-to-liquid heat exchanger and thence to the cold air intake of a forced air furnace via a liquid-to-air heat exchanger. A thermostat may control heat transfer from the mCHP to the heating system."

In some implementations, the movement of the active vortex generator may be induced by the fluid flow through the heat exchanger channel. In some implementations, the movement of the active vortex generator may be induced through an externally applied force on the active vortex generator. An actuated active vortex generator is particularly suited to heat exchangers with high heat flux dissipation requirements. Locating an actuated active vortex generator proximate to such high heat flux dissipation locations provides for improved heat transfer that can be activated when needed, such as upon operation of a high heat flux component."

A vehicle operating in an autonomous driving mode is able to identify parking locations that may be occluded or otherwise not readily visible. A best case estimation for any potential parking locations, including partially or fully occluded areas, is compared against predictions for identified visible parking locations. This can include calculating a cost for each potential parking location and comparing that cost to a baseline cost. Upon determining that an occluded location would provide a more viable option than any visible parking locations, the vehicle is able to initiate a driving adjustment (e.g., slow down) prior to arriving at the occluded location. This enables the vehicle to minimize passenger discomfort while also providing notice to other road users of an intent to pull over."
