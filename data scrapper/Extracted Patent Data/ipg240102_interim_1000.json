The fuel grain comprises a stack of fused layers, each layer formed as a plurality of fused abutting concentric circular beaded structures arrayed to define a center port. During operation, an oxidizer is introduced along the center port, with combustion occurring along the exposed port wall. Each circular beaded structure defines geometry that increases the surface area available for combustion. As each layer ablates the next abutting layer, exhibiting a similar geometry, is revealed, undergoes a gas phase change, and ablates. This process repeats and persists until oxidizer flow is terminated or the fuel grain material is exhausted. To safely achieve this construction, a fused deposition additive manufacturing apparatus, modified to shield the nanocomposite material from the atmosphere, is used."

A computer controller associated with a tower of an irrigation system receives an indication of parameter modification. The system is then able to change parameters at a component of the tower control system based on the received parameters. The system stores the current angle sensed between two adjacent span members. If the stored angle is between two threshold levels, a drive signal is provided to a motor. The system is operable to selectively apply a drive signal at a tower in an align mode. The system provides the ability to digitally modify a threshold that is used in a machine run-mode to operate the motor at a tower."

The assembly includes a broadcast feeder that sprays feed from a spinning tray driven by a motor. The feeder housing includes domed plates above and below the tray to direct the spray of feed peripherally and prevent varmints from operating the tray manually. The feeder housing may include an attachment plate to attach the feeder to the inside or outside of the bottom of the hopper. The housing may include a collar that is threadedly connectable to a downwardly extending neck on the attachment plate so the housing can be easily connected to and disconnected from the hopper. A chute control plank in the neck of the housing opens and closes the chute to allow removal of the feeder from the hopper without spilling feed."

    "description": "The present invention has found that chimeric animals suffer from noticeable inflammation after birth, though neither immune response nor inflammation in the fetal period of these animals has been reported hitherto. This is an unexpected finding since chimeric animals in the fetal period were exclusively analyzed in prior studies and thus it is deemed that immunotolerance has been theoretically established therein. The present invention provides a composition for suppressing immune response or inflammation in the fetal period of a born chimeric animal."
